# Clustering

The RabbitMq Helper is a tool that streamlines the RabbitMq clustering process on Windows. See [Clustering Guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html) and [Highly Available (Mirrored) Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html) for vanilla instructions. 

> The helper does not assist with load-balancing. See [Load balancing](loadbalancing.md) for details.
