# RabbitMq Helper
The Rabbit MQ Helper is a tool whose purpose is to assist with installing [Rabbit Mq](https://www.rabbitmq.com)

Rabbit Mq is not a Thycotic product and we do not receive revenue for it. We built the Rabbit Mq Helper to help our customers more easily install Rabbit Mq (Rabbit is an important component of Secret Serverâ€™s on-premises environment).

## What can the helper do for me?
