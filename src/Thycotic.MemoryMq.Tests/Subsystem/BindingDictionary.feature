Feature: BindingDictionary

#Background: 
#	Given there exists an object of type "Thycotic.MemoryMq.Subsystem.BindingDictionary, Thycotic.MemoryMq" stored in the scenario as BindingDictionaryTest
#	And there exists a RoutingSlip stored in the scenario as RoutingSlipTest with exchange TestChange and routing key TestRoutingKey
#	And there exists String stored in the scenario as ExchangeNameTest
#	And there exists a ConcurrentDictionary stored in the scenario as ConcurrentDictionaryTest

#Scenario: AddBinding should call TryAdd on ConcurrentDictionary
#	When the method AddBinding on BindingDictionary BindingDictionaryTest is called with routing slip RoutingSlipTest and exchange ExchangeNameTest
#	Then the method TryAdd on ConcurrentDictionary substitute ConcurrentDictionaryTest is called with routing slip RoutingSlipTest and exchange ExchangeNameTest

#Scenario: TryGetBinding should call TryGetValue on ConcurrentDictionary
#	When the method TryGetBinding on BindingDictionary BindingDictionaryTest is called with routing slip RoutingSlipTest and exchange ExchangeNameTest
#	Then the method TryGetValue on ConcurrentDictionary substitute ConcurrentDictionaryTest is called with routing slip RoutingSlipTest and exchange ExchangeNameTest
