This project should contain interfaces/classes that are used across different repos 
(Thycotic.PasswordChangers, Distributed Engine, ihawu, etc)

No functionality should be placed here, and there should be NO references to other Nuget packages.

A solution named 'Thycotic.SharedTypes' exists to make it easier for TeamCity to build the SharedTypes Nuget package.
