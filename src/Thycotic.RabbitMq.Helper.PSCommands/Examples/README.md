## Development/local PFX and CA certificate

The example Development/local PFX and CA certificate can be used for testing but should not be used in production. The test PFX password is "password1"

Be sure add the localhostca.cer to your Local Computer > Trusted Root Certification Authorities or your clients will reject the server certificate.
