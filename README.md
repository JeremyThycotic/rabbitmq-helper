# RabbitMq Helper
The Rabbit MQ Helper is a tool whose purpose is to assist with installing Rabbit Mq (https://www.rabbitmq.com/).  

RabbitMq is not a Thycotic product and we do not receive revenue for it.  We built the RabbitMq Helper to help our customers more easily install RabbitMq (RabbitMq is an important component of Secret Serverâ€™s on-premises environment). 

This project is still being migrated. Your patience is appreciated.
